Here i'll try to summarize my notes around Generative Art and the incredible work of [Ling Dong][LingDongShanShui] generating 
Shan Shui style images using javascript and procedural generation.

> Shan shui painting first began to develop in the 5th century,[1] in the Liu Song dynasty.[2] It was later characterized by a group of landscape painters such as Zhang Zeduan,[3] most of them already famous, who produced large-scale landscape paintings. These landscape paintings usually centered on mountains.

I've following [Zverok][zverok] diary to understand how generative artwork can converge into this kind of artistic works.
